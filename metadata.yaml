description: The world examined by the ancient Greek philosophers and poets was distinctly
  different from our own. And that context, the author argues, has been missing from
  later evaluations of their work. Here is the Greek view of life in the classical
  age perspectives on the state, the individual, religion, and art as seen by writers
  such as Aristotle, Euripides, Homer, Plato, and Sophocles, among many others.
